                        Auto Sequential Panel is uniquely designed to control maximum of 
                        4 units with separate set points, differentials and time delays 
                        for each units. They are specifically designed for air conditioning 
                        applications wherein the units get cuts off at desired set points and 
                        is restarted at a temperature of set points plus differential. 
                        ASP features sequential operation of units with desired time 
                        intervals and thus makes the units no overload conditions.

                        <br/>
                        We have integrated GSM Module with new advanced Panel with SIC. 
                        All the critical alarms will be notified via SMS to preconfigured 
                        mobile numbers. We can save maximum of 5 Mobile numbers. 
                        Most volatile feature is that we can control, switching on/off, 
                        set point changes like that upto 22 settings we can set via one master 
                        Mobile number.Upto 20 alarm Event Loggers we can view with this SIC.
